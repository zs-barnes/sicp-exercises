This is my attempt at the exercises in the textbook "Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs". 


I'm using the free online text [here](https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf).

[This](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/full-text/book/book.html)
version of the text is useful for copying the procedures to use in the repl.

To install mit-scheme on Mac OS, I used:
```
brew install mit-scheme
```
Then to run the scheme repl, run:
```
scheme
```
